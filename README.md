# VisionTransformerClassifier
Learning to understand and implement a Vision Transformer Classifier by Example

#
This implementation is more or less a copy-paste from the "mildlyoverfitted" github account. I just added a couple of extra lines of codes for my learning purpose. All the credit for the implementation goes to the author of that account as well as authors and contributors of github.com/rwightman/ from where the first implementation of such code comes.
